## Testing Tips

1. **Image Quality**:
   - Use good lighting
   - Keep text horizontal 
   - Ensure clear, legible handwriting
   - Use dark ink on white/light paper

2. **File Formats**:
   - Test with JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF formats
   - Keep file size under 10MB

3. **Expected Results**:
   - Text should be extracted accurately
   - Question/answer pairs should be detected
   - Flashcards should be generated for Q/A patterns

4. **Error Testing**:
   - Try uploading non-image files (should fail)
   - Try very large files (should fail)
   - Try images without Q/A patterns (should extract text but no flashcards)

## Sample Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Perfect Q/A Format
Create a note with clear Q: and A: patterns. Expected: Multiple flashcards generated.

### Test Case 2: Mixed Formats  
Create a note mixing different question formats. Expected: All patterns detected.

### Test Case 3: Poor Handwriting
Create a note with unclear handwriting. Expected: Some text extracted, possible OCR errors.

### Test Case 4: No Q/A Patterns
Create a note with just regular text. Expected: Text extracted, no flashcards.

### Test Case 5: Complex Layout
Create a note with diagrams, equations, and Q/A. Expected: Text and Q/A extracted, diagrams ignored.
